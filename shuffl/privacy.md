## Privacy
shuffl is designed with your privacy in mind. By using shuffl, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

### What We Collect
Some information you provide, such as your email address, Apple account password, and music listening activity, is transmitted to Apple to make use of their _Apple Music_ service. This data is protected according to [Apple's privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

Your Apple account credentials are transmitted directly to Apple and are not known or saved by us. Apple provides a unique user token that identifies the account currently signed in. We only transmit this token back to Apple.

Some aspects of your listening activity may be stored on your device, but are never transmitted to any party other than Apple.

### Other Resources
For more information on what data Apple says they collect with the _Apple Music_ service, you may find their article _[Apple Music & Privacy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204881)_ informative. Because shuffl makes use of the Apple Music web player, their article _[About Apple Music web player & Privacy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208364)_ may also be of use.

### Changes to this Policy
Changes may be occasionally made to this statement based on product evolution and user feedback. Any updates will be posted on this website.

Effective as of August 25, 2021
